# xna.js
This is the first public version of xna.js. WebGL library strongly inspired by XNA/Monogame framework.
The library is in the early stages. I'm writing it mainly to learn WebGL and create some demos. Still a lot to do here.

Examples of use:
* 2D Lighting: http://xnajs.com/examples/02/
* LD32 game entry: http://xnajs.com/ld32/release/
